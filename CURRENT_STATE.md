# Current State

## Live
`main` deployed 2026-11-07 at `6b76b84` (Pages run 42373513414, success): the **Act 2 vertical expansion**
(frozen spec `docs/ACT2_VERTICAL_EXPANSION.md`) on top of everything below. Save v4 (`mi.save.v4`, additive
fields only). Cloud Isle still locked as Coming Soon. https://nolancasama.github.io/monster-island/

## Pending on `feature/act2-vertical-expansion` (2026-11-08, uncommitted, not deployed)
Fixes for the 2026-11-07 playtest list; decisions in `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` (2026-11-08 entries).
- **Summit camera:** `upper-canopy` profile is `fixed: true` (`scene/cameraProfiles.ts`).
- **Bubble flight:** advanced per frame in `sim.ts` (`advanceBubbleRide`) from `rt.bubbleRide` timing;
  `bubbleDescent` only starts it and waits.
- **Cave mouths:** both arches, openings and braziers are baked into `lowlandPropsGeometry` (no pop).
- **First stream crossing:** `groveStream` granted on read only for a Grove save south of the stream; the ask
  is offered at both banks and the first ferry starts from the player's bank.
- **U cave:** mouth B at (68.6, -216.4) with its own pocket and portal (`caveMouthWest`); west arm along
  x ≈ 74.6; alcove, seal and chest moved to the chamber's west (67.6, -196.6). Light spreads from the
  entrance or torch that was lit.
- **Dark cave:** unlit ambient .01, silhouette .045, glow at 3%; the fire channel has its own material
  (no ambient, .012 silhouette) so it does not trace the route.
- **Render budget:** Upper Canopy draws only on the high layer or while the lowland draws within 70 m.
- **Specs:** `camera.spec.ts` expects `ruined-causeway` at the Causeway point; `vertical-expansion.spec.ts`
  compiles (it had blocked `npm run build`), covers mouth B and both-bank asks, and was checked with a
  known-bad build (mouth B portal removed, ferry forced north: both new tests failed).

Verified so far: tsc and build, 925 unit tests, `vertical-expansion` 12/13 then the one race fixed in the spec
(zone is assigned a frame after the layer switch), cave/stream/summit renders at 1366×768 judged by Claude.
Full suite: running (`MI_LONG_TIMEOUT=3600000 npm run e2e`).

## Next steps
1. Finish the full suite; fix or triage failures (`water-ropes` "entrance rope … safe landing" is known flaky).
2. With the user's OK: commit, fast-forward `main`, push (Pages deploys).
3. Optional polish: the root-seal chest sits at the left edge of the fixed cave view, partly behind the wall
   lip (`.tmp/shots/vertical/after/seal-open-chest-*.png`). It works; it just isn't showcased.

## Act 2 vertical expansion (live, slices A–H)
- **Causeway:** one fixed camera `ruined-causeway`; Grove–Causeway stone door opens once `grove` is cleared.
- **Grove stream:** `world/groveStream.ts`, Bubbo ferry ("Can you swim?").
- **Layers:** `region.layer` (`ground | cave | high`); golden test `layers-ground.test.ts` (both mouth pockets
  removed, otherwise unchanged).
- **Cave:** `world/cave.ts`, `scene/Cave.tsx`, `scene/models/cave.ts`. `caveTorches` (Ember) or fire on any
  brazier/torch; Leafy root seal → chest with 45 coins, 2 amber, Glow Crystal.
- **Upper Canopy:** `world/upperCanopy.ts`, `scene/UpperCanopy.tsx`; falls to checkpoints, unstable leaves.
- **Summit and bubble:** `flow/summit.ts`; Causeway landing (84.5, -254.5), or the upper rope foot until
  `grove` or `canopy` is cleared.

## Tools
- `tests/e2e/zz-vertical-shots.spec.ts`: controller screenshots (`SHOT_TAG=after`, optional `SHOT_ONLY`),
  skipped otherwise. `.tmp/pw-before.config.ts` serves an old `main` build for before shots.

## Earlier work (all merged and live)
Water/MP/ropes (`docs/WATER_MP_CANOPY_ROPES.md`), seven improvements, Grove/Canopy expansion, U forest,
combat feel, elemental combat, Act 3 and Cloud Isle expansion. See their docs and older `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
entries. Still not tested on a real Chromebook.

## Codex / Delegated Work
None in flight. Four Codex orders on 2026-11-08 (cave, bubble, ferry, spec) were reviewed and accepted by
Claude; their output is in the uncommitted tree. Machine notes: vitest `--maxWorkers=4`; Playwright
`MI_LONG_TIMEOUT=3600000`.
